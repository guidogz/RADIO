abstract = "This paper discusses the design and development of the Open Source Energy Modeling System (OSeMOSYS). It describes the model’s formulation in terms of a ‘plain English’ description, algebraic formulation, implementation—in terms of its full source code, as well as a detailed description of the model inputs, parameters, and outputs. A key feature of the OSeMOSYS implementation is that it is contained in less than five pages of documented, easily accessible code. Other existing energy system models that do not have this emphasis on compactness and openness makes the barrier to entry by new users much higher, as well as making the addition of innovative new functionality very difficult. The paper begins by describing the rationale for the development of OSeMOSYS and its structure. The current preliminary implementation of the model is then demonstrated for a discrete example. Next, we explain how new development efforts will build on the existing OSeMOSYS codebase. The paper closes with thoughts regarding the organization of the OSeMOSYS community, associated capacity development efforts, and linkages to other open source efforts including adding functionality to the LEAP model."

@article{8392503,
abstract = {Recently, the academic and industrial literature has arrived at a consensus in which the electric grid evolves to a more intelligent, responsive, dynamic, flexible, and adaptive system. This evolution is caused by several drivers including: decarbonization, electrified transportation, deregulation, growing electricity demand, and active consumer participation. Many of these changes will occur at the periphery of the grid, in the radial distribution system, and its potentially billions of demand-side resources. Such spatially distributed energy resources naturally require equally distributed control and electricity market design approaches to enable an increasingly active “smart grid.”In that regard, this paper serves to highlight lessons recently learned from the literature and point to seven open long-term challenges facing the future design of electricity markets. They are: 1) simultaneously manage the technical and economic performance of the electricity grid; 2) span multiple operations time scales; 3) enable active demand side resources; 4) activate the power grid periphery; 5) promote synergies with interdependent infrastructures; 6) respect organizational jurisdictions; and 7) promote resilient self-healing operation. For each challenge, some recent contributions are highlighted and promising directions for future work are identified.},

As such, electrification-the conversion of previously fossil-fueled end-use processes to electricity-has been identified as a key pathway to a clean, reliable, and secure energy future. Electric vehicles are the most widely cited application of electrification, but technology improvements in electrically driven devices for buildings and industrial end uses, including heat pumps for space and water heating needs, induction stoves for cooking, infrared or ultraviolet curing processes, and electric arc furnaces for process heating, could lead to more widespread electrification across these sectors.},

abstract = {End-use electrification is one of the three pillars of deep decarbonization, which are fundamental strategies necessary to eliminate energy-system carbon emissions. As a low-carbon strategy, electrification is only effective when paired with reductions in the emissions intensity of electricity generation. Thus, any discussion of electrification's role in reducing carbon emissions, either through the direct electrification of end uses but also fuel switching to electricity derived fuels, must include supply-demand interactions within the electricity system. This article highlights what these interactions may look like in the transition to a very low-carbon energy system in the United States and some potential implications for the future of the grid and wholesale electricity markets. The concepts are primarily illustrated using updated scenarios from the 2014 U .S. Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP ) technical report.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 has brought forth many advantages and challenges for the industry players. Many organizations are strategizing to take advantage of this industrial paradigm shift, thus improving the sustainability of the enterprise. However, there are many factors such as talent development, machinery advancement and infrastructure development which involve huge investment that need to be considered. This paper presents an enhanced adaptive model for the implementation of the lean and green (L{\&}G) strategy in processing sectors to solve dynamic industry problems associated with Industry 4.0. A feature of this enhanced adaptive model is that it combines experts' experience and operational data as input in dealing with real industry application. A lean and green index is coupled in the model to serve as a benchmark and process improvement tracking indicator. This allows the industrialists to set a lean and green index (LGI) target for effective process improvement. From this integrated model, an ensemble of backpropagation optimizers is then used to identify the best-optimized strategy. This ensemble optimizer is formulated to perform operation improvement and update the targeted LGI automatically when a higher index is achieved for continuous improvement. A case study on a combined heat and power plant is performed and reflects an improvement of 18.25{\%} on the LGI. This work serves as a practical transition strategy for the industrialist desiring to improve the sustainability of the facility with Industry 4.0 elements at minimum investment cost.},

This study carries out a cross-country comparison between the regulatory frameworks of nine countries and regions - Belgium (Flanders region only), Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands and the United Kingdom - to reveal the main challenges and opportunities that these have posed to collective RE prosumers (i.e. renewable energy communities, citizen energy communities and jointly-acting renewable self-consumers). Four countries have had more favourable frameworks for collective prosumers: France, Germany, Netherlands and United Kingdom. The results indicate that the current legal framework at the EU level represents a clear opportunity for collective prosumers. Spain and Portugal have both already shifted from a restrictive regulation to implementing in 2019 a legal framework for collectives. The study provides a starting point to distil policy implications for improving legal frameworks relevant for collective RES prosumers across Europe.},

However, the emerging role of prosumers brings challenges of tracing carbon emissions behaviours and formulating pricing scheme targeting on individual prosumption behaviours. This paper proposes a novel blockchain-based peer-to-peer trading framework to trade energy and carbon allowance. The bidding/selling prices of prosumers can directly incentivise the reshaping of prosumption behaviours to achieve regional energy balance and carbon emissions mitigation. A decentralised low carbon incentive mechanism is formulated targeting on specific prosumption behaviours. Case studies using the modified IEEE 37-bus test feeder show that the proposed trading framework can export 0.99 kWh of daily energy and save 1465.90 g daily carbon emissions, outperforming the existing centralised trading and aggregator-based trading.},

abstract = {Energy system models are crucial to plan energy transition pathways and understand their impacts. A vast range of energy system modelling tools is available, providing modelling practitioners, planners, and decision-makers with multiple alternatives to represent the energy system according to different technical and methodological considerations. To better understand this landscape, here we identify current trends in the field of energy system modelling. First, we survey previous review studies, identifying their distinct focus areas and review methodologies. Second, we gather information about 54 energy system modelling tools directly from model developers and users. Unlike previous questionnaire-based studies solely focusing on technical descriptions, we include application aspects of the modelling tools, such as perceived policy-relevance, user accessibility, and model linkages. We find that, to assess the possible applications and to build a common understanding of the capabilities of these modelling tools, it is necessary to engage in dialogue with developers and users. We identify three main trends of increasing modelling of cross-sectoral synergies, growing focus on open access, and improved temporal detail to deal with planning future scenarios with high levels of variable renewable energy sources. However, key challenges remain in terms of representing high resolution energy demand in all sectors, understanding how tools are coupled together, openness and accessibility, and the level of engagement between tool developers and policy/decision-makers.},

It synthesizes and compares detailed national and sectoral deep decarbonization pathways (DDPs) to 2050 compatible with the Paris Agreement objectives and domestic development priorities in Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru. The first five countries analysed in detail the energy system and agriculture, forestry and land use (AFOLU) at a high level, while Peru focussed on a detailed analysis of AFOLU given its predominance in its GHG emissions. While economy-wide results were produced, this paper focuses on the electricity, passenger transport, and AFOLU results because of their current emissions, potential to grow, and identification of successful strategies for decarbonization (e.g. switching to clean electricity and other net-zero emissions fuels across the economy; urban planning, mode shifting, and electrification in passenger transport; and intensive sustainable agriculture, assignment of land use rights and their enforcement and afforestation in AFOLU). It also highlights where significant emissions remain in 2050, notably in industry, AFOLU, freight, and oil and gas production, all areas for future research. It derives insights for the design of domestic policy packages and identifies priorities for international cooperation. This analysis provides critical information for Long-Term Strategies, Nationally Determined Contributions and Global Stocktaking in the context of the Paris Agreement.},

abstract = {Compliance with the Paris Agreement requires the transformation of national economies to meet net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by mid-century. To accomplish this, countries need to define long-term decarbonisation strategies with near- and mid-term actions to determine their ideal future scenario while maximizing socioeconomic benefits. This paper describes the process followed to support the creation of the decarbonisation pathway for the transport and energy sectors presented in Costa Rica's National Decarbonisation Plan. We discuss in detail the technological pathway of a deep-decarbonisation future that supports reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Compared to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, our results show that the decarbonisation pathway can lead to emissions' reduction of 87{\%} in the transport and energy sectors by 2050. Energy efficiency, the adoption of electromobility, modal-shift towards public transport and active mobility, as well as reduced demand due to digitalisation and teleworking, are found to be key drivers towards the deep-decarbonisation. These measures combined enable a 25{\%} reduction of primary energy production by 2050. The results highlight that the decarbonisation scenario requires installing 4.4 GW more of renewable power plants by 2050, compared to the BAU scenario (80{\%}). We also show that additional investments for the deep-decarbonisation are compensated with the reduced operating cost.

Yet, designing such services involves an array of challenges: from demand data acquisition and processing, to building a versatile simulation framework, to finally evaluating a variety of service configurations and making recommendations. This article illustrates the process of designing and analyzing various types of on-demand mobility services using the City of Chicago, Illinois, as a test case. We start by surveying and categorizing a large number of articles on simulation-based design of on-demand mobility services. This is followed by an extensive experimental study, which analyzes how different service designs perform under real transportation demand patterns in terms of key performance indicators such as demand acceptance rate, excess ride time, deviation from the desired pickup time, vehicle occupancy, and various fleet efficiency metrics. This type of analysis helps mobility service providers and public transit authorities gain insights into the interplay of the different passenger- and fleet-related key performance indicators. Finally, we introduce the fundamental ridesharing diagram, which quantifies the relationship between passenger convenience and fleet efficiency, and helps identify socially optimal service designs.},

@article{Hilpert2018,
abstract = {Energy system models have become indispensable tools for planning future energy systems by providing insights into different development trajectories. However, sustainable systems with high shares of renewable energy are characterized by growing cross-sectoral interdependencies and decentralized structures. To capture important properties of increasingly complex energy systems, sophisticated and flexible modelling tools are needed. At the same time, open science is becoming increasingly important in energy system modelling. This paper presents the Open Energy Modelling Framework (oemof) as a novel approach to energy system modelling, representation and analysis. The framework provides a toolbox to construct comprehensive energy system models and has been published open source under a free licence. Through collaborative development based on open processes, the framework supports a maximum level of participation, transparency and open science principles in energy system modelling. Based on a generic graph-based description of energy systems, it is well-suited to flexibly model complex cross-sectoral systems and incorporate various modelling approaches. This makes the framework a multi-purpose modelling environment for modelling and analyzing different systems at scales ranging from urban to transnational.},

@article{Morrison2018,
abstract = {A mid-2017 survey shows that 28 energy system modeling projects have made public their source code, up from six in 2010, and none in 2000. Another six web-based energy sector database projects and nine hybrid projects were established during this same period, some explicitly to service open modeling. Three distinct yet overlapping drivers can explain this shift in paradigm towards open methods: a desire for improved public transparency, the need for genuine scientific reproducibility, and a nascent experiment to see whether open source development methods can improve academic productivity and quality and perhaps also public trust. The associated source code, datasets, and documentation need suitable open licenses to enable their use, modification, and republication. The choice for software is polarized: teams need only consider maximally permissive (ISC, MIT) or strongly protective (GPLv3) licenses. Selection is influenced by whether code adoption or freedom from capture is uppermost and by the implementation language, distribution architecture, and use of third-party components. Permissive data licenses (CC BY 4.0) are generally favored for datasets to facilitate their recombination and reuse. Official and semi-official energy sector data providers should also prefer permissive licensing for copyrightable material.},

@article{Savvidis2019,
abstract = {Ambitious decarbonization targets, technology-specific policies, and computational developments led to increases in the complexity and diversity of energy system models. The lack of transparency and standardization, however, renders the assessment of model suitability for specific policy questions difficult. Therefore, this paper systematically assesses the ability of energy system models to answer major energy policy questions. It examines the existing literature on model comparison schemes, then proposes a set of criteria to compare a sample of 40 models. Besides, a novel, model-oriented approach is developed in order to cluster energy policy questions. Finally, the model capabilities and the policy questions are brought together by quantifying the gap between models and policy questions. The results show that some models are very well able to answer a wide range of energy policy questions, whereas others are only suitable for a specific area of energy policy. The representation of the distribution grid, the endogenous adjustment of demand, and the technical flexibility of the energy system are among the features, where models generally lag behind. Our results provide policy-makers with guidance on crucial model features with respect to a selection of energy policy questions and suggest potential funding priorities for future energy system modeling.},

abstract = {The quality of electricity system modelling heavily depends on the input data used. Although a lot of data is publicly available, it is often dispersed, tedious to process and partly contains errors. We argue that a central provision of input data for modelling has the character of a public good: it reduces overall societal costs for quantitative energy research as redundant work is avoided, and it improves transparency and reproducibility in electricity system modelling. This paper describes the Open Power System Data platform that aims at realising the efficiency and quality gains of centralised data provision by collecting, checking, processing, aggregating, documenting and publishing data required by most modellers. We conclude that the platform can provide substantial benefits to energy system analysis by raising efficiency of data pre-processing, providing a method for making data pre-processing for energy system modelling traceable, flexible and reproducible and improving the quality of original data published by data providers.},

@article{Hulk2018,
abstract = {In this article we apply the transparency checklist methodology by Cao et al. to a case study to evaluate the degree of transparency in energy system modelling. We use a recent case study conducted by the Reiner Lemoine Institut that analyses heat and electricity supply in a German region. An analysis of the questions of the transparency checklist indicates that different issues are addressed: transparency, reproducibility and quality. The completed checklist with answers regarding the case study and its supplementing materials shows that a large majority of the transparency (93{\%}) and reproducibility criteria (73{\%}) could be satisfied. However, only a smaller proportion (47{\%}) of the questions categorised as quality criteria could be answered satisfyingly. A total of 31 out of 45 checklist questions are answered (69{\%}). More than half (53{\%}) of all questions were answered in the introduced framework, model and scenario fact sheets on the OpenEnergyPlatform. The gaps in answering the checklist (e.g., documenting assumptions, uncertainties, and validations) can be closed by an enhancement of the fact sheets and additional tools like the presented scenario log. We conclude that supplementing a final report or study with the presented fact sheets improves good scientific practice significantly while we identified existing weaknesses.},

@article{Groissbock2019,
abstract = {Historically, energy system tools were predominantly proprietary and not shared with others. In recent years, there has been an increase in developing open source tools by international research and development organizations. More than half of the open energy modeling (openmod) initiative listed tools are based on the freely available scripting language Python. Previous comparisons of energy and power system modeling tools focused on comparisons such as which tool category (e.g. optimization, simulation) or energy demand (e.g. electricity, cooling, and heating) can be considered. Until now, the assessment of incorporated functions such as unit commitment (UC) or optimum power flow (OPF) has been ignored. Therefore, this work assesses 31 mostly open source tools based on 81 functions for their maturity. The result shows that available open source tools such as Switch, TEMOA, OSeMOSYS, and pyPSA are mature enough based on a function comparison with commercial or proprietary tools for serious use. Nevertheless, future commercial, as well as open source energy system analysis tools, have to consider more functions such as the impact of ambient air conditions and part-load behavior to allow better assessments of including high shares or renewable energy sources and other flexibility measures in existing and new energy systems.},

The example also highlights RDM's approach to adaptive strategies, agent-based modeling, and complex systems.Frontiers for RDM development include expanding the capabilities of multi-objective RDM (MORDM), more extensive evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of RDM-based decision support systems, and using RDM's ability to reflect multiple world views and ethical frameworks to help improve the way organizations use and communicate analytics for wicked problems.},

The essence is proactive and dynamic planning in response to how the future actually unfolds.DAPP explores alternative sequences of decisions (adaptation pathways) for multiple futures and illuminates the path dependency of alternative strategies. It opens the decision space and helps to overcome policy paralysis due to deep uncertainty. There are different routes that can achieve the objectives under changing conditions (like ‘different roads leading to Rome').Policy actions have an uncertain design life and might fail sooner or later to continue achieving objectives as the operating conditions change (i.e. they reach an adaptation tipping point (ATP)). Similarly, opportunity tipping points may occur.Multiple pathways are typically visualized in a metro map or decision tree, with time or changing conditions on one of the axes.DAPP supports the design of a dynamic adaptive strategy that includes initial actions, long-term options, and adaptation signals to identify when to implement the long-term options or revisit decisions.},

abstract = {Energy system modellers typically choose a low spatial resolution for their models based on administrative boundaries such as countries, which eases data collection and reduces computation times. However, a low spatial resolution can lead to sub-optimal investment decisions for wind and solar generation. Ignoring power grid bottlenecks within regions tends to underestimate system costs, while combining locations with different wind and solar capacity factors in the same resource class tends to overestimate costs. We investigate these two competing effects in a capacity expansion model for Europe's power system with a high share of renewables, taking advantage of newly-available high-resolution datasets as well as computational advances. We vary the number of nodes, interpolating between a 37-node model based on country and synchronous zone boundaries, and a 1024-node model based on the location of electricity substations. If we focus on the effect of renewable resource resolution and ignore network restrictions, we find that a higher resolution allows the optimal solution to concentrate wind and solar capacity at sites with better capacity factors and thus reduces system costs by up to 10{\%} compared to a low resolution model. This results in a big swing from offshore to onshore wind investment. However, if we introduce grid bottlenecks by raising the network resolution, costs increase by up to 23{\%} as generation has to be sourced more locally at sites with worse capacity factors. These effects are most pronounced in scenarios where grid expansion is limited, for example, by low local acceptance. We show that allowing grid expansion mitigates some of the effects of the low grid resolution, and lowers overall costs by around 16{\%}.},

With this in mind, we examine four European low-carbon transitions from an unusual normative perspective: that of energy justice. Because a multitude of studies looks at the co-benefits of renewable energy, low-carbon mobility, or climate change mitigation, we instead ask in this paper what are the types of injustices associated with low-carbon transitions? Relatedly, in what ways do low-carbon transitions worsen social risks or vulnerabilities? Lastly, what policies might be deployed to make these transitions more just? We answer these questions by first elaborating an “energy justice” framework consisting of four distinct dimensions—distributive justice (costs and benefits), procedural justice (due process), cosmopolitan justice (global externalities), and recognition justice (vulnerable groups). We then examine four European low-carbon transitions—nuclear power in France, smart meters in Great Britain, electric vehicles in Norway, and solar energy in Germany—through this critical justice lens. In doing so, we draw from original data collected from 64 semi-structured interviews with expert participants as well as five public focus groups and the monitoring of twelve large internet forums. We document 120 distinct energy injustices across these four transitions, including 19 commonly recurring injustices. We aim to show how when low-carbon transitions unfold, deeper injustices related to equity, distribution, and fairness invariably arise.},

abstract = {The health co-benefits of CO2 mitigation can provide a strong incentive for climate policy through reductions in air pollutant emissions that occur when targeting shared sources. However, reducing air pollutant emissions may also have an important co-harm, as the aerosols they form produce net cooling overall. Nevertheless, aerosol impacts have not been fully incorporated into cost-benefit modeling that estimates how much the world should optimally mitigate. Here we find that when both co-benefits and co-harms are taken fully into account, optimal climate policy results in immediate net benefits globally, overturning previous findings from cost-benefit models that omit these effects. The global health benefits from climate policy could reach trillions of dollars annually, but will importantly depend on the air quality policies that nations adopt independently of climate change. Depending on how society values better health, economically optimal levels of mitigation may be consistent with a target of 2 °C or lower.},

@article{Malekpour2020,
abstract = {Sustainable development is a long-term endeavour involving deep uncertainty and requiring transformative change at multiple scales. To navigate such a grand challenge, new approaches have been developed in various academic fields, such as Policy Analysis and Sustainability Transitions. Two prominent approaches to strategic planning within these two fields are Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) and Transition Management (TM). While DMDU provides analytical concepts and tools to prepare for change (one that happens anyway, whether or not we desire it), TM offers a governance approach to condition change (one that we desire). We argue that the sustainable development agenda could benefit from an explicit cross-fertilisation across the two approaches. We will highlight the commonalities and differences between the two approaches and reflect on potential cross-connections. We argue that DMDU can benefit from the participatory process of TM, and its interventionist approach, which helps to mobilise actors and build networks for sustainability transformations. DMDU can also learn from some of the governance instruments offered by TM, such as visioning, experimentation, and social learning to better prepare for change that can only be dealt with through transformative actions. TM, on the other hand, can be enriched by analytical concepts and tools developed by and widely used in DMDU, such as tipping points and signposts, exploratory scenarios, and Exploratory Modelling, to operationalise transition pathways into actionable policy decisions. An illustrative example is used to demonstrate what a cross-connection between the two approaches might look like.},

We apply both to a hypothetical case inspired by a river reach in the Rhine Delta of the Netherlands, and compare them with respect to the required tooling, the resulting decision relevant insights, and the resulting plans. The results indicate that the two approaches are complementary. Robust Decision-Making offers insights into conditions under which problems occur, and makes trade-offs transparent. The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach emphasizes dynamic adaptation over time, and thus offers a natural way for handling the vulnerabilities identified through Robust Decision-Making. The application also makes clear that the analytical process of Robust Decision-Making is path-dependent and open ended: an analyst has to make many choices, for which Robust Decision-Making offers no direct guidance.},

abstract = {Several model-based frameworks have been introduced in support of robust decision-making. While they agree on a need to cope with uncertainty for robust inferences, the frameworks differ in the way that they treat uncertainty and obtain decision insights. In this article, we compare and contrast two such frameworks: Robust Decision Making and Epoch–Era Analysis. We critically analyse the two frameworks in terms of their aims and expected decision insights, the way they cope with uncertainty, and the extent to which they use model-based and participatory analysis. Our conceptual comparison sheds light on the strengths and limitations of the two frameworks in different contexts. We then apply both frameworks to an illustrative case to analyse their benefits and caveats in practice. We conclude that the superiority of each framework is not unconditional, and depends on the context and the problem at hand. While Robust Decision Making is a more effective framework under contested and imprecise information about the future, Epoch–Era Analysis can work better when stakeholder knowledge about the future allows a deliberative specification of future scenarios. The evaluation of both frameworks' strengths and limitations can contribute to future methodological developments in the literature on decision-making under uncertainty.},

Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM), Multi-scenario MORDM and. Many-Objective Robust Optimization (MORO) differ with respect to the degree to which robustness is considered during the search for promising candidate solutions. To assess the efficacy of these three methods, we compare them using three different policy formulations of the lake problem: inter-temporal, planned adaptive, and direct policy search. The more robustness is considered in the search phase, the more robust solutions are also after re-evaluation but also the lower the performance in individual reference scenarios. Adaptive policy formulations positively affect robustness, but do not reduce the price for robustness. Multi-scenario MORDM strikes a pragmatic balance between robustness considerations and optimality in individual scenarios, at reasonable computational costs.},

@article{Juha_2019,
abstract = {In the past, power system planning was based on meeting the load duration curve at minimum cost. The increasing share of variable generation (VG) makes operational constraints more important in the planning problem, and there is more and more interest in considering aspects such as sufficient ramping capability, sufficient reserve procurement, power system stability, storage behavior, and the integration of other energy sectors often through demand response assets. In VG integration studies, several methods have been applied to combine the planning and operational timescales. We present a four-level categorization for the modeling methods, in order of increasing complexity: (1a) investment model only, (1b) operational model only, (2) unidirectionally soft-linked investment and operational models, (3a) bidirectionally soft-linked investment and operational models, (3b) operational model with an investment update algorithm, and (4) co-optimization of investments and operation. The review shows that using a low temporal resolution or only few representative days will not suffice in order to determine the optimal generation portfolio. In addition, considering operational effects proves to be important in order to get a more optimal generation portfolio and more realistic estimations of system costs. However, operational details appear to be less significant than the temporal representation. Furthermore, the benefits and impacts of more advanced modeling techniques on the resulting generation capacity mix significantly depend on the system properties. Thus, the choice of the model should depend on the purpose of the study as well as on system characteristics.

@article{Welsch2012a,
abstract = {'Smart Grids' are expected to help facilitate a better integration of distributed storage and demand response options into power systems and markets. Quantifying the associated system benefits may provide valuable design and policy insights. Yet many existing energy system models are not able to depict various critical features associated with Smart Grids in a single comprehensive framework. These features may for example include grid stability issues in a system with several flexible demand types and storage options to help balance a high penetration of renewable energy. Flexible and accessible tools have the potential to fill this niche. This paper expands on the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS). It describes how 'blocks of functionality' may be added to represent variability in electricity generation, a prioritisation of demand types, shifting demand, and storage options. The paper demonstrates the flexibility and ease-of-use of OSeMOSYS with regard to modifications of its code. It may therefore serve as a useful test-bed for new functionality in tools with wide-spread use and larger applications, such as MESSAGE, TIMES, MARKAL, or LEAP. As with the core code of OSeMOSYS, the functional blocks described in this paper are available in the public domain. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{WELSCH2014600,
abstract = {Efforts to meet climate change mitigation and energy security targets spur investments in variable renewable energy sources. Their implications for the operation of power plants are frequently investigated drawing on unit commitment and dispatch models. However, the temporal granularity and operational detail these models consider is commonly omitted in the broader family of long-term energy system models. To compensate this short-coming, these two types of tools have sometimes been ‘soft-linked' and harmonised for limited simulation years. This paper assesses an alternative approach. We examine an extended version of an open source energy system model (OSeMOSYS), which is able to capture operating reserve and related investment requirements within a single tool. The implications of these model extensions are quantified through comparison with an Irish case study. That case study examined the effects of linking a long-term energy system model (TIMES) with a unit commitment and dispatch model (PLEXOS). It analysed the year 2020 in detail, applying a yearly temporal resolution that is over 700 times higher than in OSeMOSYS. Without increasing temporal resolution (and computational burden) we show that results of the enhanced OSeMOSYS model converge to results of TIMES and PLEXOS: Investment mismatches decrease from 21.4{\%} to 5.0{\%}. The OSeMOSYS analysis was then extended to 2050 to assess the implications of short-term variability on future capacity investment decisions. When variability was ignored, power system investments in 2050 were found to be 14.3{\%} lower. This might imply that energy policies derived from such long-term models – of which there are many – may underestimate the costs of introducing variable renewables and thus meeting climate change or energy security targets.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a soft-linking methodology that employs detailed simulation outputs from a dedicated power systems model to gain insights and understanding of the generation electricity plant portfolio results for the electricity sector from a separate energy systems model. We apply the methodology and present and discuss the results. The motivation for this soft-linking is to provide a transfer of information from the power systems model strong points to the energy systems model and use this information to improve and develop understanding of energy systems model results. Part of this motivation is derived from a view that one specific energy modeling tool cannot address all aspects of the full energy system in great detail and greater insights and progress can be gained by drawing on the strengths of multiple modeling tools rather than trying to incorporate them all into one comprehensive model. The methodology takes an optimized generation portfolio for a specific year from an energy systems model and undertakes a detailed high resolution chronological simulation of the same portfolio in the power systems model with added degrees of technical detail. Results presented here show that in the absence of key technical constraints, an energy systems model can potentially undervalue flexible resources, underestimate wind curtailment and overestimate the use of baseload plant.},

abstract = {Due to the increasing deployment of intermittent renewables, the residual load profile, as seen by the dispatchable generation units, becomes lower and more volatile. This paper introduces a new system planning model on a power plant resolution, taking into account technical operational constraints. The objective of this model is to determine the optimal set of generation units, able to serve a given demand. Two initial solutions are obtained; one from a classical screening curve model, and another from a model using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). These initial solutions are perturbed and combined with an operational model to validate and further improve the solution. The developed model complements other models available from the literature, in its level of detail (power plant level and full year – hourly time resolution) combined with a fast computation time ({\textless}1h). The evolution of the optimal amount of generation capacity as a function of the installed wind capacity is examined in a case study. As the share of wind power increases in the portfolio, a shift takes place from base load generation towards mid and peak load. This shift is triggered both by the lower demand and the increasing volatility. This demonstrates that operational constraints of power plants (individual basis) have an important impact on the configuration of the optimal generator set, and need being considered, especially at increasing rates of intermittent renewables.},

abstract = {Optimal design and operation of multi-energy systems involving seasonal energy storage are often hindered by the complexity of the optimization problem. Indeed, the description of seasonal cycles requires a year-long time horizon, while the system operation calls for hourly resolution; this turns into a large number of decision variables, including binary variables, when large systems are analyzed. This work presents novel mixed integer linear program methodologies that allow considering a year time horizon with hour resolution while significantly reducing the complexity of the optimization problem. First, the validity of the proposed techniques is tested by considering a simple system that can be solved in a reasonable computational time without resorting to design days. Findings show that the results of the proposed approaches are in good agreement with the full-scale optimization, thus allowing to correctly size the energy storage and to operate the system with a long-term policy, while significantly simplifying the optimization problem. Furthermore, the developed methodology is adopted to design a multi-energy system based on a neighborhood in Zurich, Switzerland, which is optimized in terms of total annual costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Finally the system behavior is revealed by performing a sensitivity analysis on different features of the energy system and by looking at the topology of the energy hub along the Pareto sets.},

In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making.},

By comparing model results in terms of costs and installed capacities across different methods, this study shows that the best method depends heavily on input data and the setup of model constraints. This implies that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the problem of time step reduction, but heuristic approaches appear promising. In addition, the 25years of time series demonstrate considerable inter-year variability in wind and PV power output. This further complicates the problem of time detail in energy models as it suggests long time series are necessary. Model results with high shares of PV and wind generation using a single or few years of data are likely unreliable. Better modeling and planning methods are required to determine robust scenarios with high shares of variable renewables. The methods are implemented in the freely available open-source modeling framework Calliope.},

abstract = {In this paper, an innovative agent-based model is developed to simulate emergent patterns arising from individual actions to analyze opportunities for modal shift in Denmark (ABMoS-DK). Themodeling processsimulates the interaction between travelers (agents) and the network, and applies aheuristic algorithm to model travelers'rational decision making process based on tangible costs (ticket price, fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs) and Value of Travel Time (VOTT) explained by Value of Time (VoT), travel time and level of service. The traveler is described by a set of socio-economic attributes (income, family structure, place of residence, car/bike ownership) and the utility is derived from properties of alternative modes to determine whether to use non-motorized, public or private transport. Fluctuation of tangible costs and value of travel time can provide comparative advantages to the alternative modes and has the potential to affect the utility of the mode derived by traveler and change mode choice decision. A set of “pull” and “push” policy scenarios are formulated to help us understand how different factors affect mode choice in transport. We find that disincentivizing private cars has the highest potential for shifting from car use followed by incentives for sustainable modes and expansion of public transport infrastructure. The paper concludes that capturing rational behavioural features of consumers with fine level of heterogeneity in modelling will help to better understand the dynamics of the transportation system and consequently assist policy makers to better identify and target consumer groups with the highest shift potential.},

abstract = {Energy/Economy/Environment/Engineering (E4) models have been rarely apt to represent human behaviour in transportation mode adoption. This paper contributes to the scientific literature by using an E4 model to analyse the long-term decarbonisation of the Danish transport sector. The study is carried out with TIMES-DK, the integrated energy system model of Denmark, which has been expanded in order to endogenously determine modal shares. The methodology extends the technology competition within the modes to competition across modes by aggregating the passenger modal travel demands into demand segments based on the distance range. Modal shift is based not only on the levelised costs of the modes, but also on speed and infrastructure requirement. Constraints derived from the National Travel Survey guarantee consistent travel habits and avoid unrealistic modal shifts. The comparison of model versions with and without modal shift identifies its positive contribution to the fulfilment of the Danish environmental targets. Four sensitivity analyses on the key variables of modal shift assess how their alternative realizations affect the decarbonisation of the transport sector and enable shifting away from car. The results indicate that less strict travel time budget (TTB) and increased speed of public bus lead to a more efficient decarbonisation by 2050.},

abstract = {In the Nordics, transportation accounts for almost 40{\%} of energy-related CO2 emissions, a higher share than most European countries. The International Energy Agency identifies modal shift as pivotal for a sustainable transition of the transport sector. This study analyses the role of modal shift in the decarbonisation of the Scandinavian energy system with TIMES-Nordic, the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) model depicting the national energy systems of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. For the first time, passenger and freight modal shift is modelled through substitution elasticities for a real case study. Transport elasticities from the literature are discussed in light of the modelling environment, and long-term direct elasticities are identified as suitable for the purpose. The results obtained with TIMES-Nordic and its version equipped with modal shift are compared under an increasing CO2 tax. For passenger, car is mainly substituted by rail and non-motorised modes, while for freight, rail replaces truck and ship. Modal shift results in a cost-effective mitigation measure, responsible for 26 PJ of lower fuel consumption in 2050, and 2.2{\%} lower cumulative CO2 emissions from transport. A sensitivity analysis on the investment costs for electric cars reveals the ineffectiveness of the CO2 tax in stimulating car substitution in a future where electric cars are more competitive and the power sector almost decarbonised. Estimates of modal shift potentials from alternative methodologies are comparable to the results obtained, highlighting the methodology solidity. Lastly, a well-balanced technology characterization among modes is identified as crucial when enabling modal shift.},

@article{TRUTNEVYTE2016182,
abstract = {Bottom-up energy system models rely on cost optimization to produce energy scenarios that inform policy analyses, debates and decisions. This paper reviews the rationale for the use of cost optimization and questions whether cost-optimal scenarios are adequate proxies of the real-world energy transition. Evidence from ex-post modeling shows that cost optimization does not approximate the real-world UK electricity system transition in 1990–2014. The deviation in cumulative total system costs from the cost-optimal scenario in 1990–2014 is equal to 9–23{\%} under various technology, cost, demand, and discount rate assumptions. In fact, cost-optimal scenarios are shown to gloss over a large share of uncertainty that arises due to deviations from cost optimality. Exploration of large numbers of near-optimal scenarios under parametric uncertainty can give indication of the bounds or envelope of predictability of the real-world transition. Concrete suggestions are then made how to improve bottom-up energy system models to better deal with the vast uncertainty around the future energy transition. The paper closes with a reflective discussion on the tension between predictive and exploratory use of energy system models.},

@article{WORKMAN2021127,
abstract = {Integrated assessment models are often used to evaluate the role of different technologies in meeting global climate goals. Such models have been criticised for failing to address the deep uncertainties and plurality of values that are fundamental to energy transitions. One consequence is that model scenarios overwhelmingly depend on large-scale carbon dioxide removal to hold warming to below 2 °C. Here we propose an alternative approach using Scenario-Focused Decision Analysis (SFDA) as methods that embrace decision making under deep uncertainty. SFDA can accommodate a range of value sets and perspectives, and most importantly can integrate value-based decision-making in designing climate policy. We specifically consider Robust Decision Making (RDM) as an exemplar of SFDA for developing climate policy. We outline an iterative five-stage framework for RDM using the role of carbon dioxide removal in long-term mitigation pathways as an example. The five steps comprise (i) participatory definition of goals, values, potential policy options and uncertainties; (ii) modelling the performance of policy portfolios across a wide range of future scenarios; (iii) visualisation and identification of portfolio vulnerabilities; (iv) analysis of trade-offs; and (v) development of policy strategies. SFDA, and specifically RDM, provide untapped opportunities for diverse actors to explore alternative mitigation pathways and evaluate the robustness of climate policy choices through “deliberation with analysis”. In relation to carbon dioxide removal methods, RDM provides a framework for evaluating their potential for safely meeting climate goals in a societally acceptable manner.},

Impressive advances in computer and data sciences have allowed for a multitude of complex energy system optimization models. In our manuscript, we assess the hypothesis of a positive correlation between complexity of a model and accuracy of its results. For this, we propose a framework based on alternative model formulations and apply it in a case study with 160 different, more or less complex, implementations of power system optimization models for dispatch and investment. Our results indicate that a certain degree of complexity is indeed necessary to obtain sufficiently accurate results. However, a careful balancing is also necessary for acceptable use of computational resources. In terms of partial load efficiency of conversion processes, our findings indicate that (two) different formulations should be used for dispatch and for investment decisions. Furthermore, a model including simple grid constraints comes with only minor increases in complexity compared to a model assuming a copper plate. Moreover, the combination of multiple technical constraints for conversion processes leads to a significant gain in accuracy while the combination of multiple time-coupling constraints is a major complexity driver.},

An alternative to the power integration process considers higher penetration of distributed photovoltaics and biogas power plants as well as lower hydro capacity expansion in Brazil. Features related to costs, carbon emissions, hydro reservoirs, technological performance, electricity demand, population growth, time zones and reserve margin were considered.

Power is generated by a combined steam Rankine cycle and an organic Rankine cycle. Ten different refrigerants are used for the organic Rankine cycle, among which R123 has the best performance. In addition, four fluids are used as the geothermal fluid, among which Therminol 59 has recorded the best performance. Solar intensity, geothermal mass flow rate, geothermal fluid temperature, and steam turbine inlet pressure have proven to be the most prominent parameters affecting the exergy efficiency and cost. After analyzing the proposed system from the energy, exergy and exergoeconomic points of view, a multi-objective-optimization-genetic-algorithm is applied for improving the performance of the system. In order to apply the multi-objective optimization, Engineering Equation Solver and MATLAB software are linked together by the Dynamic Data Exchange method. According to the obtained results. The results show that the exergy efficiency of the system and the total unit cost respectively reach to 29.95{\%} and 129.7 {\$}/GJ at the optimum point.},

@article{Workman2020,
abstract = {The majority of global emissions scenarios compatible with holding global warming to less than 2 °C depend on the large-scale use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) to compensate for an overshoot of atmospheric CO2 budgets. Recent critiques have highlighted the ethical and environmental risks of this strategy and the danger of building long-term climate policy on such speculative technological scenarios emerging from integrated assessment models. Here, we critically examine both the use of BECCS in mitigation scenarios and the decision making philosophy underlying the use of integrated assessment modelling to inform climate policy. We identify a number of features of integrated assessment models that favour selection of BECCS over alternative strategies. However, we argue that the deeper issue lies in the tendency to view model outputs as objective science, capable of defining “optimal” goals and strategies for which climate policy should strive, rather than as exploratory tools within a broader policy development process. This model-centric decision making philosophy is highly sensitive to uncertainties in model assumptions and future trends, and tends to favour solutions that perform well within the model framework at the expense of a wider mix of strategies and values. Drawing on the principles of Robust Decision Making, we articulate the need for an alternative approach that explicitly embraces uncertainty, multiple values and diversity among stakeholders and viewpoints, and in which modelling exists in an iterative exchange with policy development rather than separate from it. Such an approach would provide more relevant and robust information to near-term policymaking, and enable an inclusive societal dialogue about the appropriate role for carbon dioxide removal within climate policy.},

By adding equations to the code of OSeMOSYS, the open source energy system model, we enabled electric vehicles and related smart control strategies to be taken into account in a long term perspective. An application to a local case study explores the effect of the penetration of the electric vehicles on the power load and the role of the smart control strategies in shaving the additional peaks and pursuing environmental targets.},

abstract = {Among the several emerging dimensioning, control and deployment of future communication network paradigms stands out the human-centric characteristic that creates an intricate relationship between telematics and human activities. The hard to model dynamics of user behavior introduces new uncertainties into these systems that give rise to difficult network resource management challenges. According to this context, this work reviews several decision-making computational methods under the influence of uncertainties. This work, by means of a systematic literature review, focuses on sensor-based Internet of Things scenarios such as Smart Spaces and Industry 4.0. According to our conclusions, it is mandatory to establish a means for modeling the human behavior context in order to improve resource assignment and management.},

@article{GIUDICI2020104681,
abstract = {Deep uncertainty in future climate, socio-economic and technological conditions poses a great challenge to medium-long term decision making. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to identify solutions that are robust with respect to a large ensemble of deeply uncertain future scenarios. In this paper, we introduce ROSS (Robust Optimal Scenario Selection), a novel algorithm that uses an active learning approach for adaptively selecting the smallest scenario subset to be included into a robust optimization process. ROSS contributes a twofold novelty in the field of robust optimization under deep uncertainty. First, it allows the computational requirements for the generation of robust solutions to be considerably reduced with respect to traditional optimization methods. Second, it allows the identification of the most informative regions of the scenario set containing the scenarios to be included in the optimization process for generating a robust solution. We test ROSS on the real case study of robust planning of an off-grid hybrid energy system, combining diesel generation with renewable energy sources and storage technologies. Results show that ROSS enables computational requirements to be reduced between 23{\%} to 84{\%} compared with traditional robust optimization methods, depending on the complexity of the robustness metrics considered. It is also able to identify very small regions of the scenario set containing the most informative scenarios for generating a robust solution.},
