It is widely recognized that participatory processes lead to comprehensive solutions and allow for the establishment of an adequate understanding of the problem at hand. In general, these processes are carried out in coordination with government bodies responsible for energy or climate change policy, which facilitate the identification and involvement of key stakeholders in order to gather their perspectives. The outcome of this stage is organized into a matrix known as XLRM, which defines: performance metrics (X), strategies or actions (L), models and data (R), and uncertainties (M) embedded in the problem to be addressed. Through workshops with a balanced representation of stakeholders, mechanisms are generated to respond to questions such as:

1- What models are used to analyze energy systems, and what databases do they rely on?

2- What strategies do governments propose to achieve a sustainable and just energy transition?

3- What metrics are applied to quantify the impact of decisions and uncertainties?

4- What is the role of regulators, planners, and operators of energy systems?

In the field of energy systems, the Latin American region presents many similar characteristics: a predominantly hydroelectric generation base, regional electricity interconnections under development, natural gas and oil energy potential, hydrocarbon imports from other geopolitical regions, challenges in passenger mobility and freight transport, a vehicle fleet largely dependent on hydrocarbons, and the pressing need to reformulate urban development
